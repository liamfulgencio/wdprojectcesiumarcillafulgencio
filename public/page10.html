        "Dress to Impress" is a popular game released on November 27, 2023 in the known app, "Roblox." Players must style human-like avatars 
        with clothes and accessories, following the given theme, in 325 seconds. After the timer has finished, each player will show off their outfit
        s in a runway, in which other players will vote the fit from one to five stars. The three players with the most votes will be shown in the po
        dium after the voting. The player will start off as a "New Model," and with playing and making good outfits, they will slowly rise to get the r
        ank "Top Model." "Dress to Impress" started off as a small game with only a few thousand players, but their Summer update in June sparked hundreds
        of thousands of players, with their new clothes and accessories. Famous people like singer Madison Beer and influencer James Charles have also gotte
        n into the game. Recently on their Halloween update, even more players were hooked into the game, to the point that at the release of it, at October
        19, 2024, 1.1 million players were actively playing, marking the peak of the game's popularity.
